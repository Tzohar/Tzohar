# Hi there, I'm [Tzohar](https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/576058/jewish/The-Shining-Stone-of-Noahs-Ark.htm) 


<p align="center">
  <i>
    "A very great tower, that affords the sight of a fire in the night time... <br>
    Yet is the haven it self, when you are got into it, a very safe one. <br>
    Into which is brought what the country wants; and what abundance the country affords <br>
    is hence distributed into all the habitable earth."
